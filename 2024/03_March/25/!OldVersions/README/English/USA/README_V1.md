- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today after a 1,111 day hiatus. It was a little stressful for the 2 days before I returned, as I didn't know how to re-acclimate. Returning was actually very easy. I had an extremely good time playing today. I received lots of rewards, and began construction on my 169th floor (a residential level) did some friend visits, restocking, and unlocked a 6th golden ticket. The session went on longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 12th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
- I came back to Tiny Tower for a second consecutive week, and had an excessively long session. I have become more critical of the game, but I don't entirely hate the new updates, as long as you can play older versions in a virtual machine. The game has always been freemium, but there are just so many things that require watching an ad now. Also, the interface surrounding all of it, and everything that goes on at once is a bit overwhelming. Still, this is like the Capital City of Nimblebit games, so it deserves work to be done on it. I received lots of rewards today, completed many quests, began construction on my 170th floor (a residential level) and my 171st level (also a residential level) coins are so easy to get, that they almost seem valueless now. It used to take me months to rack up 20 million coins, now I can get that many in a single day (in less than 4 hours) I got to play with the house for the first time today, the Mykea joke is nice, and I like the house idea. Bux are also so easy to get now that the house isn't going to be as much work as it would have been if the game was still like it was 3 years ago. I also finished construction on 1 monument today. I played for a very long time, and eventually wrapped up and quit. The session went on for a lot longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 19th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- I skipped my session, as I didn't have the time this week. I had an appointment, lots of work to catch up on, and I woke up late. I wanted to play today, I just didn't have the time. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today. I was on a car ride during the session. I got to experience the current state of the game with limited/no Internet connection. It isn't as playable as it should be. I did make minor progress, upgrading several monuments, and began construction on floor 172 (a residential level) I did lots of elevator trips, and not very many quests. I didn't do much else here today. - 2024, Monday, March 4th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay for a 2nd consecutive week. I woke up really early today, and thought I might be able to start my session before 6:00 am, and have the nighttime scenery. Due to the time change, I found it was actually already almost 7:00 am. I still had a good session, which was significantly better than last week, but didn't feel as great as my 2024, February 12th or 2024 February 19th sessions. I didn't work very much on monumnets today, and made some minor progress in other areas, additionally beginning construction on a 173rd floor (which will be yet another residential level) along with lots of elevator trips, and an increasing level of quests. I played for a long time, before eventually wrapping up and quitting. - 2024, Monday, March 11th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay for a 3rd consecutive week. I woke up at a normal time today, and stretched my session before an afternoon medical appointment. I had a good session, which was slightly better than last week, but didn't feel as great as my 2024, February 12th or 2024 February 19th sessions. I didn't work very much on monumnets today, but made some minor progress in other areas, additionally beginning construction on a 174th floor (which will be yet another residential level, residential floor #100) along with lots of elevator trips, and a small number of quests. I played for a long time, before eventually wrapping up and quitting. - 2024, Monday, March 18th

### Updates

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I have not updated the game in a really long time. I played an older version of the game for the first segment of my session, but decided to do the update that I was worried about. It wasn't as game breaking as I expected, but it doesn't entirely feel like the same game anymore. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
- No new updates were needed. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- My session was skipped today. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- No new updates were needed, I couldn't get them regardless, as I had spotty Internet during gameplay. - 2024, Monday, March 4th
- An update was available today, but I decided not to get it yet. - 2024, Monday, March 11th to 2024, Monday, March 18th

### Golden tickets

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I earned a 6th golden ticket today via a quest reward. The new version of the game makes it so you can boost floors with a golden ticket multiple times. I am going to continue using only 1 boost per level, until there are no levels left to boost this way, then I will start double and triple boosting. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
- I did not earn any golden tickets today.
- My session was skipped today. - 2024, Monday, February 26th

### House

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- No older entries
- I unlocked the house today for 25000 bux, and did very brief customizations to it. The cost of unlocking the region was 25000 bux. The Mykea joke was good, and with the way bux are earned now, it shouldn't be too hard to customize the house. - 2024, Monday, February 19th

- Nothing was done with the house today - 2024, Monday, March 4th to 2024, Monday, March 18th

- No updates to opinion. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- The game is a lot harder to play without an Internet connection compared to how it was in the past. With or without Internet, the experience feels a bit poor now. The game has been overly monetized. - 2024, Monday, March 4th
- My opinion is still pretty negative regarding the updates after 2021, but I didn't find it as bad this week. - 2024, Monday, March 11th
- My opinion is mostly the same, but I didn't have as negative of an attitude of the game today. - 2024, Monday, March 18th

- I didn't really think much about it today, but my opinion remains the same. - 2024, Monday, March 25th
