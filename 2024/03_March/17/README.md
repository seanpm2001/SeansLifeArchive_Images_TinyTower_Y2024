## Did not play Tiny Tower

<!-- TODO: For each weekly entry, make sure the date is correct. The day of the week should be modified in 4 places !-->

I did not play Tiny Tower today. Starting 2024, February 12th, this game has transitioned from a daily game to a weekly game. Daily updates can be found at the home repository [:octocat: `see the entry for 2024, March 17th`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_TinyTower/tree/master/tiny%20tower/2024/03_March/17/) [`(alt link)`](/tiny%20tower/2024/03_March/17/)

## Next session

This game is now played only on Monday. Gameplay is expected to resume on 2024, Monday, March 18th.
