- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today after a 1,111 day hiatus. It was a little stressful for the 2 days before I returned, as I didn't know how to re-acclimate. Returning was actually very easy. I had an extremely good time playing today. I received lots of rewards, and began construction on my 169th floor (a residential level) did some friend visits, restocking, and unlocked a 6th golden ticket. The session went on longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 12th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
- I came back to Tiny Tower for a second consecutive week, and had an excessively long session. I have become more critical of the game, but I don't entirely hate the new updates, as long as you can play older versions in a virtual machine. The game has always been freemium, but there are just so many things that require watching an ad now. Also, the interface surrounding all of it, and everything that goes on at once is a bit overwhelming. Still, this is like the Capital City of Nimblebit games, so it deserves work to be done on it. I received lots of rewards today, completed many quests, began construction on my 170th floor (a residential level) and my 171st level (also a residential level) coins are so easy to get, that they almost seem valueless now. It used to take me months to rack up 20 million coins, now I can get that many in a single day (in less than 4 hours) I got to play with the house for the first time today, the Mykea joke is nice, and I like the house idea. Bux are also so easy to get now that the house isn't going to be as much work as it would have been if the game was still like it was 3 years ago. I also finished construction on 1 monument today. I played for a very long time, and eventually wrapped up and quit. The session went on for a lot longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 19th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- I skipped my session, as I didn't have the time this week. I had an appointment, lots of work to catch up on, and I woke up late. I wanted to play today, I just didn't have the time. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today. I was on a car ride during the session. I got to experience the current state of the game with limited/no Internet connection. It isn't as playable as it should be. I did make minor progress, upgrading several monuments, and began construction on floor 172 (a residential level) I did lots of elevator trips, and not very many quests. I didn't do much else here today. - 2024, Monday, March 4th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay for a 2nd consecutive week. I woke up really early today, and thought I might be able to start my session before 6:00 am, and have the nighttime scenery. Due to the time change, I found it was actually already almost 7:00 am. I still had a good session, which was significantly better than last week, but didn't feel as great as my 2024, February 12th or 2024 February 19th sessions. I didn't work very much on monumnets today, and made some minor progress in other areas, additionally beginning construction on a 173rd floor (which will be yet another residential level) along with lots of elevator trips, and an increasing level of quests. I played for a long time, before eventually wrapping up and quitting. - 2024, Monday, March 11th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay for a 3rd consecutive week. I woke up at a normal time today, and stretched my session before an afternoon medical appointment. I had a good session, which was slightly better than last week, but didn't feel as great as my 2024, February 12th or 2024 February 19th sessions. I didn't work very much on monumnets today, but made some minor progress in other areas, additionally beginning construction on a 174th floor (which will be yet another residential level, residential floor #100) along with lots of elevator trips, and a small number of quests. I played for a long time, before eventually wrapping up and quitting. - 2024, Monday, March 18th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week due to severe issues with my schedule. - 2024, Monday, March 25th to 2024, Monday, April 15th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I didn't have enough time before a morning appointment, and decided to continue to prioritize my schedule, instead of resuming gameplay today. - 2024, Monday, April 22nd
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I didn't have enough time before a morning appointment, and decided to continue to prioritize my schedule, instead of resuming gameplay today. I am still working on getting caught up. - 2024, Monday, April 29th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I have fallen really far behind, and needed to get caught up today. I also had 2 appointments today. - 2024, Monday, May 6th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had an appointment this morning, and I also wanted to spend time doing graphic design work. I recently resumed graphic design work last night after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. - 2024, Monday, May 13th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had an appointment this afternoon, and I also wanted to spend time doing graphic design work. I recently resumed graphic design work last week after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. It is expected to take until 2024, June 10th before I can tone it down to a normal pace. Additionally, I am trying to get my profile repository back up to date, and to finish off the 4 year anniversary update by 2024, May 25th. All of these tasks ate into my time, and prevented me from playing Tiny Tower. Additionally, GitHub is having a severe bug lately, where uploads continuously hang and fail, and it can take up to an hour to make a 100 file push. I have to calculate this into the risk/reward for playing a game. - 2024, Monday, May 20th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had a lot of work to do, and was behind on multiple projects. I recently resumed graphic design work two weeks ago after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. It is expected to take until 2024, June 10th before I can tone it down to a normal pace. My GitHub profile update was completed on 2024, May 25th, so that freed up some time. All of these tasks ate into my time, and prevented me from playing Tiny Tower. Additionally, GitHub is having a severe bug lately, where uploads continuously hang and fail, and it can take up to an hour to make a 100 file push. I have to calculate this into the risk/reward for playing a game. - 2024, Monday, May 27th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had work to do, an appointment today, and didn't know how much time I would have. I recently resumed graphic design work three weeks ago after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. It is expected to take until 2024, June 10th before I can tone it down to a normal pace. There have been some severe missteps lately, so it may take even longer. These tasks ate into my time, and prevented me from playing Tiny Tower. Additionally, the GitHub bug where uploads continuously hang and fail (which can make it take up to an hour to make a 100 file push) seems to have gone away completely, as of yesterday. If it can stay this way, I may resume most other games more willingly when I get the time. - 2024, Monday, June 3rd

### Updates

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I have not updated the game in a really long time. I played an older version of the game for the first segment of my session, but decided to do the update that I was worried about. It wasn't as game breaking as I expected, but it doesn't entirely feel like the same game anymore. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
- No new updates were needed. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- My session was skipped today. - 2024, Monday, February 26th

### BitBook

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

No older entries available.

</details>

- There was a BitBook post today (2024, August 26th) that was disappointing, as it highlighted how a recent update destroyed one of the comments the game generates. BitBook doesn't assign enough characters to finish the line as of 2024 August. The last letter `w` should have been the word `wurst` (4 characters too long) - 2024, Monday, August 26th

### Friend visits

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- I didn't do any friend visits today. - 2024, Monday, July 15th to 2024, Monday, July 29th

### House

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- No older entries
- I unlocked the house today for 25000 bux, and did very brief customizations to it. The cost of unlocking the region was 25000 bux. The Mykea joke was good, and with the way bux are earned now, it shouldn't be too hard to customize the house. - 2024, Monday, February 19th

### Opinion on updates

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- No older entries
- I have become more critical of the game, but I don't entirely hate the new updates, as long as you can play older versions in a virtual machine. The game has always been freemium, but there are just so many things that require watching an ad now. Also, the interface surrounding all of it, and everything that goes on at once is a bit overwhelming. Still, this is like the Capital City of Nimblebit games, so it deserves work to be done on it. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- No updates to opinion. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- The game is a lot harder to play without an Internet connection compared to how it was in the past. With or without Internet, the experience feels a bit poor now. The game has been overly monetized. - 2024, Monday, March 4th
- My opinion is still pretty negative regarding the updates after 2021, but I didn't find it as bad this week. - 2024, Monday, March 11th
- My opinion is mostly the same, but I didn't have as negative of an attitude of the game today. - 2024, Monday, March 18th
- I didn't really think much about it today, but my opinion remains the same. - 2024, Monday, March 25th to 2024, Monday, June 10th Monday, June 24th
- I thought about it more this week. I am still unhappy with how monetized the game has gotten. - 2024, Monday, July 1st
- I still feel the same as last week, becoming slightly more unhappy with the game. - 2024, Monday, July 8th
- I felt more positive towards the game today, especially due to the night mode. - 2024, Monday, July 15th
- I felt the same this week, the exclusion of many quests confirmed to me that the game is harder to play nowadays without ads or other Internet features. - 2024, Monday, July 22nd
- I felt the same this week, but enjoyed gameplay significantly more, as I was in a better mood. - 2024, Monday, July 29th
- I felt the same this week, but enjoyed gameplay significantly less, as I was in a weaker mood. - 2024, Monday, August 5th to 2024, Monday, August 12th
- I felt the same this week. - 2024, Monday, August 19th
- I felt the same this week, except for one disappointment, where a BitBook post could not render the last 4 characters of the joke, due to the most recent update. It used to render this joke fine in the past. - 2024, Monday, August 26th
- I was having a good time today, but unfortunately, there was an electrical storm outside, so I had to cut my session short to finish up work. Lately, my electric company has been cutting the power for ~3 hours almost every time there is an electric/heavy wind storm, and I have to rely on battery backup and a mobile hotspot. It has already flickered twice. - 2024, Monday, September 2nd
- I enjoyed the game a little less than last week. - 2024, Monday, September 9th
- I enjoyed the game a bit more than last week. - 2024, Monday, September 16th
- I enjoyed the game a bit more than last week. I feel a lot of my dislike for the newer updates is because of parachute guy, which I feel should be something that can be turned on/off. - 2024, Monday, September 23rd
- I enjoyed the game a bit more than last week. - 2024, Monday, September 30th
- I felt the same, and enjoyed the game a little more than last week. - 2024, Monday, October 7th
- I felt more negative about the game today due to the broken functionality, enjoying the game less than last week. What is the point in over-monetizing a game, then having the monetization system break? - 2024, Monday, October 14th
- I felt more positive about the game today due to the improved functionality, enjoying the game more than last week. - 2024, Monday, October 21st to 2024, Monday, November 4th

## Feature requests

### Parachute guy toggle

<!-- Notes 2024.09.23 
Parachute guy (optional) req
!-->

- Parachute guy can be helpful, but he can also be annoying. Parachute guy sometimes ruins the picture of your tower when you zoom out, and parachute guy may slow down progress in other areas. I feel parachute guy should have a toggle in the settings, where he can be turned on/off. - Proposed 2024, Monday, September 23rd

## Expand app menu

The menu should be expanded to have more than 1 page, and continue to function similarly to an iOS/Android-like app menu. If the menu is expanded, the old options should be brought back, and NimbleBit should be creative, and add some new options as well. - Proposed 2024, Monday, October 7th
