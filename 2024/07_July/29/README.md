!-->

- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today after a 1,111 day hiatus. It was a little stressful for the 2 days before I returned, as I didn't know how to re-acclimate. Returning was actually very easy. I had an extremely good time playing today. I received lots of rewards, and began construction on my 169th floor (a residential level) did some friend visits, restocking, and unlocked a 6th golden ticket. The session went on longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 12th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 12th
- I came back to Tiny Tower for a second consecutive week, and had an excessively long session. I have become more critical of the game, but I don't entirely hate the new updates, as long as you can play older versions in a virtual machine. The game has always been freemium, but there are just so many things that require watching an ad now. Also, the interface surrounding all of it, and everything that goes on at once is a bit overwhelming. Still, this is like the Capital City of Nimblebit games, so it deserves work to be done on it. I received lots of rewards today, completed many quests, began construction on my 170th floor (a residential level) and my 171st level (also a residential level) coins are so easy to get, that they almost seem valueless now. It used to take me months to rack up 20 million coins, now I can get that many in a single day (in less than 4 hours) I got to play with the house for the first time today, the Mykea joke is nice, and I like the house idea. Bux are also so easy to get now that the house isn't going to be as much work as it would have been if the game was still like it was 3 years ago. I also finished construction on 1 monument today. I played for a very long time, and eventually wrapped up and quit. The session went on for a lot longer than expected. I will return again next week, but as of 2024, February 19th, a separate 2024 Tiny Tower Git-image repository is not available. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- I skipped my session, as I didn't have the time this week. I had an appointment, lots of work to catch up on, and I woke up late. I wanted to play today, I just didn't have the time. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay today. I was on a car ride during the session. I got to experience the current state of the game with limited/no Internet connection. It isn't as playable as it should be. I did make minor progress, upgrading several monuments, and began construction on floor 172 (a residential level) I did lots of elevator trips, and not very many quests. I didn't do much else here today. - 2024, Monday, March 4th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay for a 2nd consecutive week. I woke up really early today, and thought I might be able to start my session before 6:00 am, and have the nighttime scenery. Due to the time change, I found it was actually already almost 7:00 am. I still had a good session, which was significantly better than last week, but didn't feel as great as my 2024, February 12th or 2024 February 19th sessions. I didn't work very much on monumnets today, and made some minor progress in other areas, additionally beginning construction on a 173rd floor (which will be yet another residential level) along with lots of elevator trips, and an increasing level of quests. I played for a long time, before eventually wrapping up and quitting. - 2024, Monday, March 11th
- I returned to Tiny Tower gameplay for a 3rd consecutive week. I woke up at a normal time today, and stretched my session before an afternoon medical appointment. I had a good session, which was slightly better than last week, but didn't feel as great as my 2024, February 12th or 2024 February 19th sessions. I didn't work very much on monumnets today, but made some minor progress in other areas, additionally beginning construction on a 174th floor (which will be yet another residential level, residential floor #100) along with lots of elevator trips, and a small number of quests. I played for a long time, before eventually wrapping up and quitting. - 2024, Monday, March 18th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week due to severe issues with my schedule. - 2024, Monday, March 25th to 2024, Monday, April 15th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I didn't have enough time before a morning appointment, and decided to continue to prioritize my schedule, instead of resuming gameplay today. - 2024, Monday, April 22nd
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I didn't have enough time before a morning appointment, and decided to continue to prioritize my schedule, instead of resuming gameplay today. I am still working on getting caught up. - 2024, Monday, April 29th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I have fallen really far behind, and needed to get caught up today. I also had 2 appointments today. - 2024, Monday, May 6th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had an appointment this morning, and I also wanted to spend time doing graphic design work. I recently resumed graphic design work last night after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. - 2024, Monday, May 13th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had an appointment this afternoon, and I also wanted to spend time doing graphic design work. I recently resumed graphic design work last week after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. It is expected to take until 2024, June 10th before I can tone it down to a normal pace. Additionally, I am trying to get my profile repository back up to date, and to finish off the 4 year anniversary update by 2024, May 25th. All of these tasks ate into my time, and prevented me from playing Tiny Tower. Additionally, GitHub is having a severe bug lately, where uploads continuously hang and fail, and it can take up to an hour to make a 100 file push. I have to calculate this into the risk/reward for playing a game. - 2024, Monday, May 20th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had a lot of work to do, and was behind on multiple projects. I recently resumed graphic design work two weeks ago after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. It is expected to take until 2024, June 10th before I can tone it down to a normal pace. My GitHub profile update was completed on 2024, May 25th, so that freed up some time. All of these tasks ate into my time, and prevented me from playing Tiny Tower. Additionally, GitHub is having a severe bug lately, where uploads continuously hang and fail, and it can take up to an hour to make a 100 file push. I have to calculate this into the risk/reward for playing a game. - 2024, Monday, May 27th
- I skipped my Tiny Tower session this week, as I had work to do, an appointment today, and didn't know how much time I would have. I recently resumed graphic design work three weeks ago after a hiatus of over 2 months, and I am working on trying to get caught up here. It is expected to take until 2024, June 10th before I can tone it down to a normal pace. There have been some severe missteps lately, so it may take even longer. These tasks ate into my time, and prevented me from playing Tiny Tower. Additionally, the GitHub bug where uploads continuously hang and fail (which can make it take up to an hour to make a 100 file push) seems to have gone away completely, as of yesterday. If it can stay this way, I may resume most other games more willingly when I get the time. - 2024, Monday, June 3rd

- I have not updated the game in a really long time. I played an older version of the game for the first segment of my session, but decided to do the update that I was worried about.

### House

- No older entries
- I unlocked the house today for 25000 bux, and did very brief customizations to it. The cost of unlocking the region was 25000 bux. The Mykea joke was good, and with the way bux are earned now, it shouldn't be too hard to customize the house. - 2024, Monday, February 19th
- My session was skipped today. - 2024, Monday, February 26th
- Nothing was done with the house today - 2024, Monday, March 4th to 2024, Monday, March 18th

### Opinion on updates

<details><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</b></p></summary>

- No older entries
- I have become more critical of the game, but I don't entirely hate the new updates, as long as you can play older versions in a virtual machine. The game has always been freemium, but there are just so many things that require watching an ad now. Also, the interface surrounding all of it, and everything that goes on at once is a bit overwhelming.
